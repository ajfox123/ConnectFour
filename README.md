# Connect Four - COMP3608 Assignment 1

This is Brain4's final code for the DATA3888 project. It is a Connect Four game that uses Spikerbox tracking eye-movement as input. The AI opponent was coded for a COMP3608 assignment by a group member.

## Installation
**NOTE**: You must have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer to run this. If this is your first time downloading Python, you should [install/upgrade your pip](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pip-python-package-manager). Once you have downloaded Python, clone this repository to your computer by clicking the green button "*Code*" and then "*Download ZIP*".

Once you have unzipped the files, open the terminal and navigate to the folder that contains `requirements.txt` and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running The Game
To play the game using a Spikerbox, connect it to your computer and change the port to the correct one. Now navigate to the folder containing `ConnectFourPygame.py` in your terminal and run the command `python3 ConnectFourPygame.py` from the terminal. In some cases, you may have to run `python ConnectFourPygame.py` instead.

# Connect Four - COMP3608 Assignment 1

This is my code for USYD's COMP3608 Assignment 1. We were assigned the task of building a Connect Four AI program that uses either minimax or alpha beta searching with a given heuristic function to find the next move.

## Installation
**NOTE**: You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your computer to run this. If this is your first time downloading Python, you should also [upgrade your pip](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pip-python-package-manager). Once you have downloaded Python, clone this repository to your computer by clicking the green button "*Code*" and then "*Download ZIP*".

Once you have unzipped/extracted the files, open the terminal/command line and navigate to the folder that contains `requirements.txt`.

Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running The Game
To run the game, navigate to the folder containing `ConnectFourPygame.py` in your terminal and run the command `python ConnectFourPygame.py`.
